# LineageOS 16 releases for galaxy a5, all SM-A500 variants

This repo contains lineageos 16 builds for all Galaxy A5 SM-A500 variants!


<b>How to install lineageos 16</b>:

Flash twrp recovery <br />
Wipe system, data, cache, and dalvik if you are using a different rom or android version (for example lineage 15.1), otherwise, if you are just updating lineageos 16.0 you won't have to do that. <br />
Flash lineageos 16.0 zip <br />
Flash your variant's RIL fix zip otherwise RIL (the ability to make calls, send sms, connect through cellular data) will probably not work <br />
Optional but recommended: download and flash gapps <br />
Reboot


<b>IMPORTANT!</b>

As written above you will have to flash RIL-fix zip to make RIL working. <br />
If your variant is SM-A500FU, you will not have to flash any RIL-fix zip! <br />
RIL zip contains device-specific libsec-ril.so and libsec-ril-dsds.so, if the device supports dual sim. <br />
In addition it also contains a script to change build.prop device-name props from SM-A500FU ones to your variant's ones. <br />
Here are the RIL-fix zips. Make sure you install the one corresponding to your variant!
